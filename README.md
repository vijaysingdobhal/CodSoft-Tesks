# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. It is a beginner-friendly project that utilizes a well-known dataset from the Titanic disaster. By analyzing individual passenger data such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and embarkation location, the model provides insights into the factors that influenced survival rates.

## Project Overview

This Titanic Survival Prediction project demonstrates the following:
- Data analysis and visualization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Building and evaluating a classification model

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains information about individual passengers, including:
- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger
- `Survived`: Survival (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Name`: Name of the passenger
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger
- `Age`: Age of the passenger
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `Ticket`: Ticket number
- `Fare`: Passenger fare
- `Cabin`: Cabin number
- `Embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load and inspect the dataset to understand the structure, identify missing values, and assess data quality.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, especially for `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`. Clean and format the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the relationship between different features and survival rates using visualization techniques.
4. **Feature Engineering**: (Optional) Engineer new features, such as `FamilySize` and `Title`, to capture additional insights.
5. **Data Preprocessing**: Encode categorical features and scale numerical data as required for the model.
6. **Model Training**: Build a classification model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or others, to predict the `Survived` outcome.
7. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Analyze the modelâ€™s feature importance to understand influential factors.
8. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and insights gained from the analysis and model predictions.

## Results

The model achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting passenger survival, with key influential features identified, such as:
- Passenger's class and gender
- Age
- Family size
- Port of embarkation

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage

To view or execute the code:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the steps involved in building a simple classification model with a focus on data analysis and feature engineering. Through this analysis, we gain insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.
